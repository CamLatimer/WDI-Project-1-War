### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: **Meets Expectations**

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

***Great Job listing your technologies, approach and including user stories in the README!***


* __Technical Requirements__: **Exceeds Expectations**

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

***Your project definitely meets all of the technical requirements but also adds additional layers of complexity using the measurement bar at the bottom for example. The layout and design is great. Awesome job!***

* __Code Quality__: **Meets Expectations**

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

***You did a great job using components of OOJS, forEach Methods, functions, etc. in your code. The only additional feedback I have is to clean up your code, especially removing the console.logs. This will help for easier readability as well as identifying future errors***

* __Problem Solving__: **Exceeds Expectations**

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

***Your project is fairly complex in a great way. I think you did a great job working through your problems and implementing not only your MVP but Silver/Gold features as well!***
